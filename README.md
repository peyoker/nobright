# NoBright

> A lightweight Windows utility for complete and instant control over your screen's brightness.

**NoBright** lets you dim your display to its minimum level with a configurable hotkey—perfect for late-night sessions—or set a precise level using the manual slider. It runs silently in your system tray, staying out of your way until you need it.
